# Image Processing API Project


# Requirement

This project needs to have installed NodeJS and npm and Angular.


# Development Steps

Feel free to use this overview and the rubric specifications to create this project. You are always welcome to design and implement your own workflow, but if you are stuck or could use some inspiration, we've included the following walkthrough the help you get up and running.

1. Scaffold your project using the Angular CLI, and install any dependencies.

2. Generate the product list component. Having the product list as the "main" page is a great start for your users.

3. Begin building the component logic and template. What is the function of the product list? What logic is included in the TypeScript component, and how does its HTML template function? Does this component collect any user input? If so, how does information entered by the user relate to properties in the TypeScript component?

4. Consider the hierarchy of components. Which other components do you anticipate you'll need to build in this application? Which component(s) should render other components? Which components should represent a parent-child relationship? Feel free to draw out this hierarchy as a chart to help you visualize the relationships between components.

5. Create the TypeScript model for products in the app. Any available product should be of this type rather than an ordinary object.

6. Generate the service(s). Which service(s) make the most sense? For any particular service, what is its function? Hint: You may want to create a service to handle any asynchronous data.

7. Fetch data from the API (or included data.json file) and render products in your product list.

8. Generate and create other components. How do these components interact, if at all, with the component you first created? How can we facilitate sharing information between them?

9. Create routing between components. Which components are linked by the router? How is the app routing module set up and configured to ensure the page doesn't reload during navigation?

10. Ensure that inputs are validated in the client. For example, your checkout form needs to collect information from the user in order for them to complete the checkout process. How do you ensure that you are collecting accurate information from the user?
